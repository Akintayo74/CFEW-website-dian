            Project Earn is a community-driven waste management initiative promoting circular economy. It empowered communities, especially women and youth, to collect, sort, reuse, and recycle waste, particularly single-use plastics, to generate income and create jobs. The project also provided economic empowerment by equipping participants with zero-waste skills and facilitating savings and small loans through a community cooperative (Village Savings and Loan Association).

            The ClimRes project is an integrated approach to promoting community recovery using eco-friendly activities, livelihood empowerment initiatives, and establishing a Community Resource Recovery Facility.

            This project tackles methane emissions from organic waste by promoting composting as a sustainable solution. The project seeks to train community members, households, individuals, and waste pickers to set up and manage composting systems, biogas channels, and black soldier fly farming. The initiative teaches proper composting techniques, repurposing methods, and ways to turn composting into a small business. A key feature is the Material Recovery Facility (MRF), which processes organic waste and supports a self-sustaining system that reduces landfill waste, advances the circular economy, and serves as a model for sustainable urban waste management and global climate action.
