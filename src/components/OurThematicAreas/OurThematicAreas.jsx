            The health thematic area of our organisation recognizes the intrinsic connection between a healthy environment and human health and well-being. Here we work to mitigate environmental health risks through projects that address clean air, sanitation and water pollution, promote the use of clean and renewable energy, and reduce exposure to harmful/toxic chemicals. By ensuring clean and safe environments, we aim to prevent diseases and improve the overall quality of life for people and the communities we serve.
